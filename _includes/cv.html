        <h1>About</h1>
            <p>Currently, I am a university student studying computer science
            and international relations. I am enthusiastic about technology and
            development, passionate about news and current events, and very
            interested in the technical aspects of these areas and others. I'm also
            interested in international relations and current events, photography,
            theatre, and community service. Since starting college, I've decided
            to make computer science and development my primary academic focus.
