A few weekends ago I drove up to New Hampshire with some friends to hike Mount Washington, the tallest peak in the northeast! I only had my phone with me, so the photocred for the better quality photos goes to my friend Sarah, who brought a DSLR :)  This was the night before the "blood moon/ super moon" so it was really beautiful once the sun went down. Here's a few pictures. I highly recommend the trip!
