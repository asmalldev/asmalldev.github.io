###Photomi<em>whats</em>copy?
I recently re-discovered some images from a few years ago when I was doing photography more actively. The thing that made these specific images stand out to me among many others I was looking through is that they're photomicroscopy images- images taken through a microscope. Think <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=macro+photography&es_sm=122&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=LBokVYKvGoS8sAWB4YDgCA&ved=0CAcQ_AUoAQ&biw=587&bih=621" target="blank">macro photography</a> but done with a microscope in order to go even smaller. If that peeks your interest, I highly suggest you give it a try- if you can... unfortunately the equipment is rather expensive, but if you can borrow equipment from a school or organization like I did, I think it's worth a try.

It's also different from usual macro photography in that your depth of field when using a microsope is <em>so</em> small, that in order to have a reasonable amount of the subject in focus, you need to take many images at slightly different focus points and combine them using computer software. I thought this was pretty damn cool (although I couldn't find any open source software that does this).

Take a look and the images and let me know what you think. <strong>WARNING:</strong> If you're squeemish about insects or other bugs, you may want to turn back now.

### Naming These Critters
I'm no taxonomist, but after I shot these I did try to classify and name them to the best of my ability. It's very possible I made mistakes, let me know if you notice one. As for the last one, I either never determined what its name is or can't remember it. Those compound eyes sure are cool though! If you do know it's name and have time for a more literal kind of bug bounty (sorry, I couldn't help myself) let me know!
