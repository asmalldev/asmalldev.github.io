	<h1>About</h1>
		<p>Currently, I'm a university student studying computer science and 
		international relations. I am enthusiastic about technology and 
		development, passionate about public radio and news, and very interested 
		in both the technical and legal aspects of these areas and others. In 
		the past I've spent a considerable amount of my time exploring 
		photography, theatre, social sciences, and community service but have since
		decided to focus primarily on computer science. I'm eager to get involved in new projects
		and learn from technology development in the real world.
