			<h1>About</h1>
				<p>Currently, I am a university student studying computer science
				and international relations.
				I am enthusiastic about technology and development, passionate
				about public radio and news, and very interested in both the
				technical and legal aspects of these areas and others. In
				the past I've spent a considerable amount of my time exploring
				photography, theatre, social sciences, and community service but
				have since decided to focus primarily on computer science.
				<strong>I'm eager to get involved in new projects and learn from
				technology development in the real world.</strong>
