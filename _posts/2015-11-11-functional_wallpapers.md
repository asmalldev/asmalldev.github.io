Learning new languages and practices usually involves some memorization- soaking up new syntaxes and building up a relevant vocabulary. I've found this to be especially true while learning x86_64 assembly- which comes with a <strong>LOT</strong> of stuff crammed into its instruction set. `cmp` these, `jmp` there, `leaq` of this thing into that thing. It's certainly a lot to memorize. In an attempt to engrain these in my head, I decided to keep these instructions in my face whenever I'm at the computer- by using my wallpaper. Using GIMP and Inkscape, I drew up a simple wallpaper that is a quick reference for x86_64. Now whenever I'm stepping through assembly in GDB and think "WTH is this thing doing now???" I can just look at my desktop. I also made one with the ASCII table. Take a look below:


####Intel x86_64 Reference
<div class="center_imgs"><img class="post_img_large" src="/img/post2/x86.png" alt="x86 assembly quick reference"></div>

####ASCII Table
<div class="center_imgs"><img class="post_img_large" src="/img/post2/ascii.png" alt="ASCII table"></div>

####Do Work (ASCII and Assembly)
<div class="center_imgs"><img class="post_img_large" src="/img/post2/work.png" alt="ASCII and assembly"></div>

<p class="post_middle">Now, having a quick reference may be useful, but (like many other people I'm sure) I love having a pretty wallpaper to greet me after booting up. So, I added some drop shadow and voil√†- information in your face AND pretty pictures:</p>

####Sunset Background
<div class="center_imgs"><img class="post_img_large" src="/img/post2/sunset_work.png" alt="mountain sunset"></div>

####Wood Background
<div class="center_imgs"><img class="post_img_large" src="/img/post2/wood_work.png" alt="reference over wood"></div>

If you like these and want to tweak any them, let me know and I can send you the SVG!
