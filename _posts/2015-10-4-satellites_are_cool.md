This summer I had the very good fortune of getting hired as an intern by Pumpkin Inc. Pumpkin is a company that builds hardware and software for Cubesats, a type of small satellite used for space research missions.

<p style="font-size: .95em; text-align: center; background: rgba(255, 238, 215, 0.65);">Thanks to Adrian Kilian, 3D modeler extraordinaire, for the fancy cubesat blender animation!</p>

I won't get too specific about the mission they were doing at the time, but working with such smart people was a very gratifying experience; I loved getting to learn from people who are more experienced and knowledgeable than I am.

I mostly worked alongside more experienced devs on some telemetry software for the company's upcoming Cubesat mission. This helped me bolster my understanding of databases and general software architecture. I also provided some help with an on-board Linux computer since I had a little extra experience from being a Linux desktop user. At the risk of sounding too flashy: I basically got to help send Linux into space (which is pretty much a dream job as far as I'm concerned).

It was really refreshing to do some real-world programming and see embedded Linux in action. I'm taking a Computer Systems course now and am making many connections between the lower-level view I'm getting of computing and the work I was seeing at Pumpkin.

I hope I'll get to work with more companies like Pumpkin in the future and look forward to having more experience and skills to bring to the table.
