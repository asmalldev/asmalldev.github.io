### About
I am a currently a university student studying computer science and international relations. I am enthusiastic about technology and development, passionate about public radio and news, and very interested in both the technical and legal aspects of these areas and others. In the past I've spent a considerable amount of my time exploring photography, theatre, social sciences, and community service. After settling on computer science, I'm eager to learn and experience more aspects of software and technology development in the real world.
