        <h1>About</h1>
            <p>I'm currently a computer science student, and am enthusiastic about technology and
            development, passionate about news and current events, and very
            interested in the technical aspects of these areas and others. I'm also
            interested in international relations and current events, photography,
            theatre, and community service. While I enjoy having many interests, programming and development are my primary focus.
